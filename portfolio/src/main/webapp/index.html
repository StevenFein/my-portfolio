        <p>Hello world, my name is Steven Fein. I am a second year
            CS Major at California State University, Northridge. I enjoy building
            things and learning new technologies. Happy coding!
        </p>

        <p>I have always enjoyed technology  from a young age, especially videogames and computers. My
            first exposure to CS was an elective I took in high school and I learned the very basics about creating
            instructions for a computer. I really enjoy being able to build things and modify everything down to 
            the slightest detail. 
        </p>

        <h2>Some of my projects</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A webapp called FridgePal that generates food recipes. This was my final project while I was a student
                for Google CSSI 2019.
                <a href="https://plutus-247923.appspot.com/">Visit FridgePal!</a>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>An app that simulates playing the lottery for my AP Computer Science Principles exam in
                high school. Built using the AppLab environment from Code.org.

        <h3>Photogallery</h3>

        <p>This is a photo from one my favorite hiking trails near my house.
            It overlooks the San Fernando Valley.
        </p>
        <img src="images/overlook.jpg" width="950" height="600"><br>
        
        <p>This is my favorite theme park, Six Flags Magic Mountain. It contains many world record setting rollercoasters
            and is one of my favorite places to hang out with friends.
        </p>
        <img src="images/six_flags.jpg"><br>
        
        <p>My newest interest is astrophotography. I am just beginning, 
            but there is a lot of photographing potential especially when the sky is clear.
            This photo is not mine, I am still waiting for the right weather conditions to be able
            to take the right shot, but this is what I imagine I will see (hopefully).
